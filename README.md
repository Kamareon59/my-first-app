# my-first-app

I am building this weather app as part of the SheCodes Plus workshop (https://www.shecodes.io/plus#tour), to showcase what I learned, what I taught myself, and to start filling my online portfolio. 

It is designed to (eventually) show commonly used weather data for over 200,000 global locations, including current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. So far, I am particularly proud that both the converters for celsius to fahrenheit and vice versa are hidden under 1 button. 

☀️ Thanks for checking out my project! ☀️
