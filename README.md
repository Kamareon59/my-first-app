# my-first-app

I am building this weather app as part of the SheCodes Plus workshop (https://www.shecodes.io/plus#tour) to showcase what I've learned, what I've taught myself, and to start filling out my online portfolio. 

It is designed to (eventually) show commonly-used weather data for over 200,000 global locations, including current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. It does this by calling the amazing OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). So far, I am particularly proud of the Random Location button, and that the Metric to Imperial conversion (and vice versa) works for the Forecast + Details as well as the main temperature. I'm planning to try adding a couple more features even after my course is finished.

☀️ Thanks for checking out my project! ☀️



PS: Don't be like me and get too excited with the Random Location button... it WILL overload the great-but-free API 😉
